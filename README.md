📄 RAG Document Search — AI-Powered PDF Question Answering

An intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to upload a PDF and ask natural-language questions — with answers generated strictly from the document itself. Built using LangChain, LangGraph, and modern LLM tooling, this project demonstrates how AI can transform static documents into interactive knowledge systems.

📋 Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline that:

📝 Ingests a PDF
✂ Breaks it into meaningful chunks
🧠 Converts text into vector embeddings
🔍 Retrieves relevant sections
🤖 Uses an LLM to answer questions
✅ Ensures answers ONLY come from the document

It follows a graph-based architecture using LangGraph — making the pipeline modular, traceable, and production-ready.

Think of it as ChatGPT — but limited to your own document.
